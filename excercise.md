# Coding exercise for Backend API Developer (Senior) job interview

The purpose of this exercise is to test fundamental skills required for the Senior Backend API developer role. We are looking for a clean, **simple**, well tested, maintainable code that follows best practices.

The assignment should take 2-4 hours of work. However, you are expected to send back the code in 1-2 days after.

## Prime numbers REST JSON API

We would like to see you designing and implementing a simple REST JSON API.

### Requirements

1. An endpoint that returns a list of numbers and the corresponding values from the normal sequence of prime numbers from 1 to N with support for pagination. Parameterize page size (defaults to 100).

### Guidelines

- Work on your solution using a preferred version control system. It is **important** that you commit frequently and share the link to the final repository with us. 
- Consider potential performance and concurrency problems. Be aware of limitations of your implementation (memory, cpu, time, network etc).
- Document your code and API (readme or generated docs).
- We value code quality. Use consistent and clean style across the codebase.  
- Make sure your API handles invalid input well.
- Make sure code can be compiled and tests can be run and pass. Optionally add Makefile.
- Use available public libraries, but keep in mind that solution should be easily maintainable.
